I highly encourage to take Colt Steele’s Course “The Web Developer Bootcamp.” This course is very informative and contains pretty much everything you need to know to start in web development.\n\nHere is the course link: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ Have fun learning!","tags":["Javascript","React","NodeJS"],"author":{"id":"cjw3ortfby01008308bgz1fp8","name":"Jamie Vardy"}}},"path":"post/cjw3p22mvy0o00830lgyr73la"}
